 * `2026-05-02T08:30:00.000Z`) — left as a string in the SDK so callers can
 * parse with the date library of their choice (`DateTimeImmutable`,
 * Carbon, etc.) without forcing a specific dependency.
 *
 * `receipt` is nullable because SRC issuance may have failed at the time
 * the sale was registered — see {@see Receipt::$fiscal} for partial states.
